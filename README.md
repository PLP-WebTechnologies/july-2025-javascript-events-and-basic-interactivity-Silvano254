📋 Project Title: JS Form Validation
🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates client-side form validation using vanilla JavaScript—no libraries or frameworks. It features a responsive registration form with real-time feedback, modular code, and clean styling. The goal is to simulate a real-world user registration experience while practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and validation logic.

🚀 Live Demo
Coming soon: Link to GitHub Pages or local deployment instructions.

Password	Minimum 6 characters
Gender	Must be selected from dropdown
Age	Must be a number between 18 and 120
🎨 Styling
Dark mode theme using CSS

Styled error messages in red

Button hover effects for interactivity

Syntax-highlighted code block using <pre><code> tags

🧠 Learning Objectives
Practice DOM selection and manipulation

Implement real-time form validation

Structure JavaScript for readability and reuse

Apply CSS for layout and feedback styling

Write professional documentation for technical projects

🛠️ How to Run
